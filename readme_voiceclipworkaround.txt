Voice Clip Importing Workaround
for Wrapper: Offline 1.2.3 Final Build (Build 72)
by KrisAnimate

To use this voice clip workaround:
Extract the contents of this .zip file to a temporary folder.
Copy the folder's contents to the folder where you installed Wrapper Offline 1.2.3 final build, overwriting any existing files.
You might want to make a backup of the entire Wrapper Offline folder first.
Use the new import.bat to import the voice clip you want to import.
To retrieve and use the imported voice clip, use the text-to-speech function, select the "Import" voice, and type anything into it.
To change the voice clip retrieved by the "Import" voice, repeat the entire process.
